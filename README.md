# spam-detection-Machine-Learning
📌 Overview

This project implements a Spam Detection System using Machine Learning techniques. The model is trained to classify messages as Spam or Not Spam (Ham) based on text content.

The classifier uses Multinomial Naïve Bayes, a common algorithm for text classification, and applies the Bag-of-Words (BoW) model to convert text into numerical features.

🚀 Features

📂 Loads and Preprocesses SMS/Email Data

🔎 Text Vectorization using CountVectorizer (Bag-of-Words)

🤖 Trains a Naïve Bayes Classifier for spam detection

📊 Evaluates Model Performance (Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, Classification Report)

📝 Allows User Input for Spam Prediction

🎨 Visualizes Data Distribution using Seaborn

🛠 Tech Stack

Programming Language: Python 🐍

Libraries:

Pandas (Data Handling)

NumPy (Numerical Computing)

Matplotlib & Seaborn (Visualization)
